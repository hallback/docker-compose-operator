summary: A machine charm that deploys and runs workloads using docker compose.
# (Required)
description: |
  The Docker Compose charm manages workloads on Juju units using Docker Compose V2.

  The charm installs Docker and Docker Compose and lets the user supply a
  docker-compose.yml file with juju config. If the running workload differs from
  the supplied config, the charm goes into maintenance status.

  The user can trigger the 'recompose' action to activate the configuration on a
  per unit basis.
